  {
    q: "What is forestry mulching?",
    a: "Forestry mulching uses a specialized machine with a rotating drum and carbide teeth to grind standing trees, brush, and stumps into a layer of natural mulch — all in a single pass. There's no burning, no hauling, and no mess left behind.",
  },
  {
    q: "How big of an area can you clear?",
    a: "We handle everything from small residential lots (quarter-acre) up to large commercial parcels (50+ acres). Most residential clearing projects are completed in a single day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you clear steep hillsides?",
    a: "Yes — we operate remote-controlled mulching equipment that can safely work on slopes up to 60°+. This lets us clear terrain that most companies have to turn down.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to the debris?",
    a: "Everything is mulched in place. Trees, brush, and stumps are ground down into a natural mulch layer that decomposes over time, enriching the soil. No burn piles, no dumpsters, no hauling costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get a quote?",
    a: "The fastest way is to use our interactive Map & Quote tool — search your address, draw the area you want cleared on satellite view, upload a few photos, and we'll send you a detailed quote, usually within 1–2 hours. You can also call us directly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are you licensed and insured?",
    a: "Yes. Keystone Terrain Co. is fully licensed and insured for commercial and residential land clearing work in Pennsylvania.",
  },
  {
    q: "What areas do you serve?",
    a: "We're based in North Huntingdon, PA and serve the Greater Pittsburgh area including Westmoreland, Allegheny, Butler, Washington, Fayette, and surrounding counties.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a typical job take?",
    a: "Most residential projects (1–5 acres) are completed in a single day. Larger or more complex projects may take 2–3 days. We'll give you a timeline with your quote.",
  },
